<br>

<b>Choice of Database System </b>
<br>

The project utilizes Google Sheets API as its database management system. The decision to use Google Sheets API over MySQL was based on several factors, including:

- <b>Real-time Collaboration</b>: Google Sheets allows multiple users to collaborate on the same spreadsheet simultaneously, enabling real-time updates and collaboration among team members.
<br><br>
- <b>Integration with Google Services</b>: Google Sheets seamlessly integrates with other Google services such as Google Drive, Google Forms, and Google Apps Script, allowing for enhanced functionality and automation.
<br><br>
- <b>Access Control and Security</b>: Using this provides robust access control mechanisms, allowing administrators to manage permissions and restrict access to sensitive data as needed.
